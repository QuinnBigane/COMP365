SECURITY IMPLEMENTATIONS (NOT a priority yet)

Upon being run for the first time, program needs to init the admin user

Login module, change password module
    needs to check that password chosen is valid 
    (meets requirements)

Import module, add record and add_record_from_import
    needs to check formatting of inputs 

count_records, check_recordID, export_database, import_database
    raise OSerros - is this what we wanna do?

    need to be commented

get_record
    need to be commented
